## Energy <a name="energy"></a>
### Electricity <a name="electricity"></a>
#### How It Works 
Commonly known as mains power. Electrons going back and forth. 60Hz is 60 back and forth per sec electrons moving.
Its made by rotation of giant magnets, where the N and S is like +ve and -ve. The water in a windmill roatates the magets. the magnets are close to coils of metal wire. The +ve and -ve rotation causes the electrons to go bak and forth resulting in DC electricity.  
Batteries are DC; they generate voltage in only one direction, and they have a polarity of positive and negative.
#### Basic Off Grid Electrical Easy Hacks
1. Solar mobile phone chargers
2. Car battery with DC to AC convertor (investigate how to safely install)
3. 

### Cooking with Gas <a name="gas"></a>
#### Gas Canister 
By far the easiest solution. Get a gas detector. Always have a spare canister there.
